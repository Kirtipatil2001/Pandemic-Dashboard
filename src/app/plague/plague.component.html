            <h5>Effects of Plague</h5>
          </div>
          <p>Often simply referred to as ''The Plague'', the Black death was one of the most devastating pandemics in human history, peaking in Europe between 1348 & 1350 with an estimated one -third of the continent's population ultimately succumbing to the disease.
          </p>
           <p>The Plague killed indiscriminately young and old, rich and poor, but especially in the cities and among groups who had close contact with the sick.Entire monasteries filled with friars were wiped out and Europe lost most of its doctors.
              In the countryside,whole villages were abandoned . The disease reached even the isolated outposts of Greenland and Iceland , leaving only wild cattle roaming free without any farmers, according to chroniclers who visited years later.</p>
          <p>Social effects of the plague were felt immediately after the worst outbreaks petered out. Those who survived benefited from an extreme labor shortage, so serfs once tied to the land now had a choice whom to work for.</p>
