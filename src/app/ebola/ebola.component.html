          </div>
          <p>
            Aside from the devastating health effects, the Ebola epidemic also had a pronounced socio-economic impact in Guinea, Liberia,and Sierra Leone. 
            According to 2014 projections from the World Bank, an estimated $2.2 billion was lost in 2015 in the gross domestic product of the three countries.
